## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Great to annouce that I create my blog on github, welcome to my blog page guys.

I graduated with MSc of CS in 2018 while I started my first job in business area to improve my communications skills.

From 2019, I have been self-studied coding skills to keep my tech stack. However, I did not use Github often in the past year. 

I realized that I lost a lot of precious things without github. 

So now, I am coming! A noob in github, but I will engage with githubers more and more! 

*Hello World!*
